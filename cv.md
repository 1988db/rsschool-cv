## About me  
Hello, I am a beginner Frontend Developer from Warsaw, Poland. In programming, I like the intellectual challenges it brings - it's like a puzzle to be solved. Besides Frontend I am an amateur cyclist and I also like hiking.  
## My goals  
In my past job as a cashier I created simple but useful app in form of website which help cashiers with their job. After some time I realised that I can give myself a try with programming and I started an on-line JS/Frontend development course in RS School.  
I like creating useful tools so currently I am working on my portfolio project "Virtual Coach" - an JS app to help with interval workouts.  
My goal is to get a Junior Frontend Developer job in the near future.
## Skills  
- HTML  
- CSS

## Code example  
  
  
    function getFormattedTime(time) {
       let hours = Math.floor(time/3600);
       let minutes = Math.floor(time % 3600 / 60);
       let seconds = time % 60;
       if (hours < 10) {
       hours = '0' + hours;
       }
       if (minutes < 10) {
       minutes = '0' + minutes;
       }
       if (seconds < 10) {
       seconds = '0' + seconds;
       }
       return hours + ' : ' + minutes + ' : ' + seconds;
    }
